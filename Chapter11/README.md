***The development is on progress! The API will be updated soon, the more talented and light-weight API will be available in this repo!***

- ***Detailed API documentation and sample jupyter notebooks that explain basic usages of API will be added!***

**You can find a sample project - case study that uses TensorFlow Object Counting API in [*this repo*](https://github.com/ahmetozlu/vehicle_counting_tensorflow).**

## USAGE

### 1.) Usage of "Cumulative Counting Mode"

#### 1.1) For detecting, tracking and counting *the pedestrians* with disabled color prediction

*Usage of "Cumulative Counting Mode" for the "pedestrian counting" case:*

    fps = 30 # change it with your input video fps
    width = 626 # change it with your input video width
    height = 360 # change it with your input vide height
    is_color_recognition_enabled = 0 # set it to 1 for enabling the color prediction for the detected objects
    roi = 385 # roi line position
    deviation = 1 # the constant that represents the object counting area

    object_counting_api.cumulative_object_counting_x_axis(input_video, detection_graph, category_index, is_color_recognition_enabled, fps, width, height, roi, deviation) # counting all the objects
    
*Result of the "pedestrian counting" case:*

**1.2)** For detecting, tracking and counting *the vehicles* with enabled color prediction

*Usage of "Cumulative Counting Mode" for the "vehicle counting" case:*

    fps = 24 # change it with your input video fps
    width = 640 # change it with your input video width
    height = 352 # change it with your input vide height
    is_color_recognition_enabled = 0 # set it to 1 for enabling the color prediction for the detected objects
    roi = 200 # roi line position
    deviation = 3 # the constant that represents the object counting area

    object_counting_api.cumulative_object_counting_y_axis(input_video, detection_graph, category_index, is_color_recognition_enabled, fps, width, height, roi, deviation) # counting all the objects

Here are some cool capabilities of TensorFlow Object Counting API:

- Detect just the targeted objects
- Detect all the objects
- Count just the targeted objects
- Count all the objects
- Predict color of the targeted objects
- Predict color of all the objects
- Predict speed of the targeted objects
- Predict speed of all the objects
- Print out the detection-counting result in a .csv file as an analysis report
- Save and store detected objects as new images under [detected_object folder](www)
- Select, download and use state of the art [models that are trained by Google Brain Team](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)
- Use [your own trained models](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) or [a fine-tuned model](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/10_Fine-Tuning.ipynb) to detect spesific object/s
- Save detection and counting results as a new video or show detection and counting results in real time
- Process images or videos depending on your requirements

Here are some cool architectural design features of TensorFlow Object Counting API:
